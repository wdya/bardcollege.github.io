      "The <a href = "https://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html">Analytical
      Engine</a> has no pretensions whatever to <i>originate</i>
      anything. It can do whatever we <i>know how to order it</i> to
      perform. It can <i>follow</i> analysis; but it has no power of
      <i>anticipating</i> any analytical relations or truths. Its province is
      to assist us to making <i>available</i> what we are already acquainted
      with." &mdash; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a>

      "Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. His excursions may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important."
